Exo 01: done
- download avec IMDB

Exo 02: done
- Size des files
- fonction 

Exo 03: done (reste exp and prompt je pense)
- Number of actual movies, actors
- Lists of movies, actors

Exo 04: done
- Questions about the lists

Exo 05: done
- Write functions :
		1. search_movie 
		2. get_movie
		3. search_actor
		4. get_actor
		5. movie_path
		Important remarks: movie_path is tricky. You need to try to implement it but you 		are allowed to fail. If you are stuck for too long, please explain what you did/try and what blocked you in your opinion. Then move on.
		
Exo 06: done
- Build a Web server with the rotes:
		1. /movies/{id} hafsa
		2. /movies hafsa
		3. /actors/{id} maissa
		4. /actors maissa
		5. /actors/{id}/costars maissa
		6. /search/actors/{searchString} hafsa
		7. /search/movies/{searchString} hafsa
		8. /actors/{id_origin}/distance/{id_destination} maissa
with the conditions :
		1. All errors should have the same format.
		2. In absence of error, the API should always return a json
		3. Each route must be documented with the return format, possible errors, and an explanation of parameters
		4. Each route that returns a list should return a maximum of 100 elements and should accept URL parameters start and limit to display limit elements starting from the start-th element. For example: /actors should return the first 100 authors, /actors?start=100 displays the next 100, and /actors?start=200&limit=2 displays the next 2 elements
		5. For each route that returns a list, the returned elements should be sortable based on a given field using a URL parameter order. For example: /movies?order=year displays the first 100 movies sorted by year
		
Exo 07: Done
- Utiliser pytest pour écrire un programme qui teste l API préc

Exo 08: Done
- Créer un serveur web (avec python et flask) qui utilise l API créé précédemment, pour afficher :
		- The complete list of movies and the complete list of costars of an actor, possibly sorted alphabetically. This actor can be searched beforehand using a substring of characters appearing in her name
		- The colloration distance between two actors. As above, the actors can be searched beforehand using a substring of characters appearing in their names. Try to format a bit (not too much). For example:
			1. The collaboration distance between Kevin Bacon and Jean Dujardin is 2
			2. Kevin bacon played in Wild things with Bill Murray
			3. Bill Murray played in The Monuments Men with Jean Dujardin
